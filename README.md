# Pixel Pet

PixelPet provides adorable, animated WebVR pets through A-Frame that can chat with their owner and respond to commands. It integrates the Watson Assistant and Tone Analyzer APIs and maintains custom entities and context variables. This enables emotionally responsive conversations between the user and their PixelPet, as well as providing different personality options and the ability for the pet to learn about its owner. In addition to accepting text input, PixelPet uses the Web Speech API to allow users to talk to their pets directly.

The inspiration behind this app is the idea that, despite being surrounded by increasingly powerful and intelligent virtual assistants, comparatively little has been done to make these assistants companionable.  They provide a great deal of logistical support to their users, but next to no emotional support. As machine learning continues to improve, it would be ideal if the virtual personalities in our lives were not only useful, but likeable and empathetic.
